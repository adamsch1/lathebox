"The toolpost has a DC motor driving a worm and wheel, and a rachet
with a click for each tool station. On the shaft holding the
toolholder there is an optical disk with three  tracks, and each tool
station has a unique coding on those three tracks.

What Denford did was to drive the motor in the forwards direction
until the correct code was read from the three tracks, then reverse
the motor against the rachet and leave it in a stalled condition.
This way tends to overheat the motor.

My circuit basically does the same, but when 'on station' only
reverses for three seconds then powers off the motor. I find that
cutting forces happily keep the rachet and pawl engaged.

I read the status of the three tracks into the parallel port of a PC,
and drive forwards until I get what I want, then using a 555 timer
run in reverse for three seconds. The motor is driven using an
L298 'H Bridge' circuit."


The hardware is as follows: 

The 3 sensor wires are opto isolated and sent to the computer port
The motor is driven by an ouput line from computer to an L298 driver ( High for fowards and low for reverse) and an 555 timer to cut the reverse after 3 seconds. A line from the timer is sent to the port to notify job done.


I hope this is helpful and a thanks to Dave Murray for help with some obvious errors in coding.

CSKPP bearing CSKXXPP where XX is diameter metric.  PP means slots in inner and outer portion of bearing for locking without a press fit.  VXB has one for $25 with 50 ft/lbs of torque capacity.  Standard sizes etc.

Hammond makes enclosures with sloped front, called console enclosures.  They are made of 14 gauge steel and are sealed and are liquid/dust proof, nema 12 rated, perfect actually. $250 cheaper than I can have a custom one made.
